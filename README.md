The Olive Oils data has eight explanatory variables (levels of fatty acids in the oils) and nine classes (areas of Italy). The goal of the analysis is to develop rules that reliably distinguish oils from the nine different areas. It is a problem of practical interest, because oil from some areas is more highly valued and unscrupulous suppliers sometimes make false claims about the origin of their oil.

Description: This data consists of the percentage composition of fatty acids found in the lipid fraction of Italian olive oils. The data arises from a study to determine the authenticity of an olive oil.

This dataset requires cleaning prior to modelling work.
